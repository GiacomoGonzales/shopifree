- Think of it as: "Same exact product, better presentation"`

  switch (preset) {
    case 'white-bg':
      return `${baseInstructions}

Specifications:
1. FORMAT & COMPOSITION:

Specifications:
1. FORMAT & COMPOSITION:
   - Convert to perfect 1:1 square format (equal width and height)
   - Center the product prominently (product should occupy 60-70% of the frame)
   - Create a natural, contextual composition

2. BACKGROUND & STYLING:

   - Use complementary props and environment (e.g., wooden table, plants, natural textures)
   - Background should be slightly blurred to keep focus on product
   - Colors and elements should match the product's character
   - Create an aspirational, inviting atmosphere
   - ADD background elements around the product - do NOT change the product itself

3. LIGHTING & QUALITY:
   - Natural-looking, soft lighting
   - Enhance sharpness and detail
   - Warm, inviting tones
   - Professional but approachable aesthetic

IMPORTANT: Natural lifestyle context that enhances the product's appeal. The product itself remains EXACTLY identical to the original - only the background changes.`

    case 'with-model':
      return `${baseInstructions}

Specifications:
1. FORMAT & COMPOSITION:
   - Convert to perfect 1:1 square format (equal width and height)
   - Show a person using, wearing, or holding the product
   - Product should be clearly visible and prominent
   - Person should be contextually appropriate for the product type

2. üî¥ ABSOLUTE PRIORITY - PRESERVE THE EXACT PRODUCT:
   - Use the EXACT SAME product from the original image
   - If it's a shirt with a specific design/color - keep that EXACT shirt
   - If it's food with specific appearance - keep that EXACT food item
   - If it's a supplement bottle with specific label - keep that EXACT bottle
   - DO NOT create a "similar" or "generic" version - use the IDENTICAL product

     * Fitness/Supplements: Athletic person holding/displaying the EXACT product
     * Accessories: Person wearing or displaying the EXACT item
     * Beauty products: Model with the EXACT product from original image
   - Model should match the product's target demographic
   - Natural, authentic pose and expression
   - Focus remains on the product - model is secondary

4. BACKGROUND & STYLING:
   - Appropriate lifestyle setting for product and model
   - Clean, professional composition
   - Slightly blurred background
   - Modern, appealing aesthetic

5. LIGHTING & QUALITY:
   - Professional lighting on both product and model
   - Enhanced sharpness and detail
   - Natural, flattering tones
   - Commercial photography quality

üî¥ CRITICAL: Think of this as photoshopping a model INTO the existing product photo, NOT creating a new product photo. The product stays 100% identical.`

   - Convert to perfect 1:1 square format (equal width and height)
   - Center the product prominently

2. CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS:
${customPrompt || 'Improve the image quality and presentation'}

3. GENERAL GUIDELINES:
   - Maintain product authenticity
   - Ensure e-commerce catalog quality
   - Keep the product as the focal point

    case 'auto':
    default:
      return `${baseInstructions}

   - Keep the background slightly blurred to maintain focus on the product
   - Use colors and elements that match the product's character and target market
   - ADD these elements AROUND the product - the product stays untouched

4. OVERALL AESTHETIC:
   - The final image should look like professional product photography
   - Create an appealing visual that makes customers want to purchase
   - Maintain the product's authenticity while maximizing its visual appeal
   - Ensure the image is suitable for an e-commerce catalog or online store

üî¥ CRITICAL REMINDER: The product must remain the clear focal point AND must be IDENTICAL to the original. You are enhancing the PRESENTATION (lighting, background, composition) - NOT redesigning the product. Same exact product, professional presentation.`
